<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

To provide clear understanding of how to choose and verify appropriate use of INCOterms when buying or selling across international borders to more accurately capture costs and risks.

<div class="section">
<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p><span class="product-name">INCOtelligent</span> smart contracts help your business navigate INCOterms for international purchasing contracts.</p>

<p>By using a set of guided questions, <span class="product-name">INCOtelligent</span> smart contracts help you select the right INCOterm for your business. (Already know which INCOterm you’d like to use? Skip this step by directly selecting your INCOterm.)</p>

<p>The legal specifications associated with your selected INCOterm are automatically inserted into your <span class="product-name">INCOtelligent</span> smart contract.</p>

<p>This legally binding smart contract can be integrated into your larger purchasing contract, ensuring that there are no inconsistencies or misunderstandings about your international shipping terms. </p>

<p>As soon as the goods are delivered to you, according to the INCOterm, payment is automatically submitted to the seller.</p>

<h2>INCOterms explained</h2>

<ul class="incoterms-explained">
	<li>If you choose <span class="incoterm inco-exw">EXW</span> (Ex Works) shipping, the buyer pays all transportation costs, bears all risks, and is responsible for every step - arranging the full shipment from the supplier to the ultimate destination. The seller is only responsible for and ensuring the goods are available for pickup from the supplier at the agreed time. The ICC recommends EXW for containerized freight. However, this is not a convenient arrangement for a buyer without an agent in the export country.</li>
	<li>If you choose <span class="incoterm inco-fob">FOB</span> (Free on Board) shipping, the seller is responsible for arranging every step to clear the goods for export from the seller’s country, up until the goods are loaded onboard the ship to leave the export country. The cost and risk are divided while the goods are onboard. The buyer assumes ownership when once the goods are onboard and arranges all other steps once the cargo leaves the export country on its way to its ultimate destination. The ICC recommends FOB for containerized freight. </li>
	<li>If you choose <span class="incoterm inco-cfr">CFR</span> (Cost and Freight) shipping, the seller is liable and responsible for all costs and freight until the goods arrive at the destination point. Once the goods are loaded on the ship, the risk passes to the buyer. The buyer is responsible for clearing the goods through customs. The ICC does not recommend CFR for containerized freight – it’s designed for bulk and break bulk cargo.</li>
	<li>If you choose <span class="incoterm inco-cif">CIF</span> (Cost, Insurance And Freight) shipping, the seller is responsible for all costs and freights until the goods arrive at the destination point and also pays insurance costs. Once the goods are loaded on the ship, the risk passes to the buyer. The buyer is responsible for clearing the goods through customs. The ICC does not recommend CIF for containerized freight – it’s designed for bulk and break bulk cargo.</li>
	<li>If you choose <span class="incoterm inco-ddp">DDP</span>, the seller pays for all transportation costs, bears all risks, and is responsible for every step – arranging the full shipment from the supplier to the ultimate destination. The ICC recommends DDP for containerized freight. However, it’s not a convenient arrangement for sellers without an agent in the import country.</li>
</ul>
